Some scripts I used to do various things with no-intro rom sets:

- rename/retrieve box art for every game (named for ARC Browser)
  - uses [libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-thumbnails) as a base, supplementing with thegamesdb.net api
- reduce to english-language only roms
- reduce multiple editions of roms down to one
  - prefer non-demo, non-prototype editions
  - prefer USA over foreign editions
  - prefer later revisions over earlier revisions

There's no documentation, so it's mainly here for informational purposes for anyone else looking to organize their own romsets via scripting.
